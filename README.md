# ðŸŽ“ C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
A group project to learn and understand sorting algorithms & Big O concepts

## At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    - At least four different sorting algorithms
    - What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
    - How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
    - What is a stable sorting algorithm
